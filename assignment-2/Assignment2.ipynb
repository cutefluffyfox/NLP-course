    "## Implement context-sensitive spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to implement:\n",
    "- spell-checking for a concrete language - Russian, Tatar, etc. - any one you know, such that the solution accounts for language specifics,\n",
    "- some recent (or not very recent) paper on this topic,\n",
    "- solution which takes into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings,\n",
    "- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster,\n",
    "- any other idea of yours to improve the Norvigâ€™s solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "Your project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n",
    "- Your implementation\n",
    "- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n",
    "- Improvements of the original approach that you have chosen to implement"

    "### Dataset decision\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all I want to make some comments regarding dataset. The main problems I faced are:\n",
    "1. It takes a lot of time to count ngram frequencies on large corpora\n",
    "2. There are no* (maybe? I struggled to find) free, large, general-purpose frequencies count online\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss details. The first point is that is takes unreasonable amount of time to calculate good general-purpose ngrams. Finding large texts is not a problem, as thouthands of data samples are available online, there even exists some benchmarks for spell-correction problem (for example, [Billion Word Benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/billion-word-benchmark)). The main downside is that to calculate good general-purpose ngrams we need to analyze a lot of text, and ideally the more text we feed, the more robust model will be. But even for small datasets such as [Norvig data](https://norvig.com/big.txt) it took me 20 seconds to calculate all statistics (it resulted in bad dependencies where metric was worther than baseline). If we scale that data up to a billion samples, it becomes unreasonable thing to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we cannot make ngram dataset ourselves, it sounds reasonable to take already existing one. However here we face another problem, ideally we need free, general-purpose ngrams that are large enough to highlight common dependencies. This task was not as easy as it seems like, as calculating ngrams is a difficult task and most of datasets are private and have paid-access. There exist some services such as [Public n-gram data](https://www.ngrams.info/download_coca.asp), however I faced difficulties accessing anything from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all this problems above, I decided to still use [Publoc n-gram data](https://www.ngrams.info/download_coca.asp) that is given us with current assignment - bigrams. Why not 5-grams? Because they contain less information in general. For some reason 5-grams dataset contain in total of 16451820 different samples, when bigrams have 286758206 (17 times more info!). For that reason, even thought bigrams do not capture long dependencies, they still more preferable, and with their heigher unique word count, they seems to be applicable in more texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram LM specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically my implementation is slight improvement over Norvig solution. The key difference - we use ngram for context-specific suggesitons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm principle is simple. If we already have \"pretrained\" language model, we can use it to calculate probabillity of seing some given word. If this probability is high enough, we can suppose that the word is correct. However if it is not, we can apply some edits (Novig's idea) and then find not just most frequent token, but most frequent in given context (there are also some edge cases when all edits are not present, then we find edit in raw vocab (idea of backoff), and if not found again, suppose initial word is correct). This solution should add context-dependency to Novig solution and make algorithm more robust overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as it is still same idea. In addition used dataset do not capture long dependencies, so not much improvement would be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The only two hyperparameters we can tune are `freq_threshold` and `edit_lim` (minimum threshold needed to be achieved for word not to be corrected, maximum edit distance). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `edit_lim` is not bound, any value greater than 3 takes minutes to compute, so in some sort `3` is limit. My experiments showed that `2` is optimal, however for faster computation I am going to use `1` in evaluation step. \n",
    "\n",
    "And speaking about `freq_threshold`, value of `0` means we will accept any word if it is possible in context, and value of `1` will try to correct each word in a text. I found that value between `1e-6` and `5e-6` provides more optimal result (I tuned it on my own examples)."

In addition it is also general-purpose and has a lot of samples we can work with. Due to the fact that I already trained model, I decided to use [Spellgram training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vishnun/SpellGram/resolve/main/train.csv) for eval.
